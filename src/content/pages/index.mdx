Hello! Writing this introduction was painful. However, isn't the whole notion of the [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history/) about letting things grow? So, I'll patch something together to give you a broad picture. Hopefully, these sentences will set the tone for you — as you can see, this website is mostly written with ad hoc rigour.

I'm Theo! I built this to host my yet-to-be-written blog, personal projects and research demos. I'm a bit of a hoarder for intellectual curio, and my eagerness to be a polymath led me to be, as I believe, a decently interesting [tree-shaped](https://arc.net/l/quote/yuvmdgzj) person.

## Me
*You can read more about me in the [Me](/me) page.*
