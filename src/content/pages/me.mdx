## Interests

I enjoy **developing systems** — be that software, schools, mental models or social structures. I like building clean, well-designed entities that work according to deliberate principles. 

- I build [CLI tools](/fig), [Obsidian plugins](/trail), [software-defined experiment runners](/cavendish) and other engineering projects. 
- I categorise my thought efforts and knowledge into neat [vaults](/obsidian-vault) and write [blogposts](/blog) laden with links. This website originated as a public mirror of my Obsidian vault.
- I engage with [rationality](/rationality) community: I want to dedicate effort to arrive at correct [maps](https://www.lesswrong.com/w/map-and-territory) of reality. I value good espitemology, culture of thought and discussion, and people's passion for truth.

I like **telling stories** — getting to immerse myself or others in a new world, explore new experiences, questions and conflicts through a skin of a fictional character and dig deep into [rational worldbuilding](/worldbuilding) brings me great joy, and has been my obsession as soon as my prefrontal core was able to handle enough abstraction.

- I run, design and research [tabletop roleplaying games](/ttrpgs). When I moved to Tbilisi, I have founded what eventually came to be the [largest TTRPG community in Georgia](https://t.me/ttrpgs_tbilisi), complete with our own [festival](https://mimic-games.com/) and other regular events. 

- I enjoy studying game design, and have tried my hand at developing computer games. I hope to eventually release a textual quest concept for which has been brewing in my head now for too long.

I mainly identify as male, but I often prefer to indicate he/they as my pronouns. I have never been exemplary masculine person, and I generally enjoy dabbing in femininity and queerness. My evidence suggests I'm heterosexual, but I'm open to possibility I'm biromantic. For pictures of me, my clothes, accessories, etc., visit [pics](/pics). 

I have recurrent moderate depression. My other groups of traits fit the profile of strong ADHD or HFA (high-functioning autism). I have been in therapy for many years.
