## Design
*For a fuller reference document, see the [DSRD](/design) page.*

I decided to go with a minimalistic design, inspirations being Paul Graham's [www.paulgraham.com](https://www.paulgraham.com/) and Dan Luu's [danluu.com](https://danluu.com/), for example. Though for purposes of practicality, TheoR.net (further referred to as "website") is a bit more loaded with features and verbose. 

## Relational structure

Website uses two orthogonal layers: **topological**, based on the [RCC-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region_connection_calculus), and **semantical**. 

### RCC-8

| Relation | Implies | Semantics                          |
| -------- | ------- | ---------------------------------- |
| DC       | DC      | Disconnected                       |
| EC       | EC      | Externally connected               |
| EQ       | EQ      | Equal                              |
| PO       | PO      | Partially overlapped               |
| TPP      | TPPi    | Tangential proper part             |
| TPPi     | TPP     | Tangential proper part inverse     |
| NTPP     | NTPPi   | Non-tangential proper part         |
| NTPPi    | NTPP    | Non-tangential proper part inverse |

### Semantical

| Relation | Implies | Semantics          |
| -------- | ------- | ------------------ |
| N        | P       | Next               |
| P        | N       | Previous           |
| R        | Ri      | References         |
| Ri       | R       | References inverse |
