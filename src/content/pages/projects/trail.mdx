# Trail

Trail is an Obsidian plugin for adding named, typed relations between notes and traversing them through a dedicated pane.

## Why Trail?

Obsidian's linking is powerful but flat — every link is equal. Trail adds semantic meaning: you can mark a link as `up::[[Parent]]` or `[[Child]]::down`, building a navigable hierarchy without folder structures.

## Features

- **Inline typed relations** using a concise `::` syntax
- **Frontmatter relations** via `relations` map properties
- **Implied relations** with forward/reverse/both/sibling direction rules
- **Hierarchy view** to browse all ancestors of the active note

## Syntax

Single relation per link, prefix or suffix:

```
up::[[Parent]]
[[Child]]::down
```

Or in frontmatter:

```yaml
relations:
  up: "[[Parent]]"
  down:
    - "Child A"
    - "[[Child B]]"
```

## Installation

Install via [BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat) using `https://github.com/theoryzhenkov/trail`, or copy the release files manually to your vault's `.obsidian/plugins/trail/` folder.
